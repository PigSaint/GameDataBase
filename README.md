# GameDataBase

GameDataBase project aims to provide the most detailed information about every videogame (console, computer and arcade) for sorting purposes. Goal is to unify in one place all available useful information for emulation purposes like MiSTer, to make possible more efficient and specific searchs. GameDataBase will be published in different files (by platform).

These are basically five-column files separated by semicolons (;) as following:

1. Game full title
2. ID (to identify multiple versions of the same game)
3. Date in format YYYY adding MM and DD if known (YYYY-MM-DD)
4. Developer
5. File

Rest of characters used are:

# = Tags with additional information about the game:
  - #1P, #2P... = Number of maximum players available
  - #4W, #8W... = Joystick ways / #0W means there's no stick
  - #1B, #2B... = Number of buttons
  - #spinner, #lightgun... = Non common control system
  - #tate, #triple... = Non common screen
  - #cps, #system16... = arcade board
  - #coop, #vs... = Two or more players mode (cooperative, versus)
  - #mameparent = Parent arcade game in MAME por specific ID
@ = Show title in original character set, if applicable. The idea is to replace default transcribed title if wanted (one or another, not both). This is particulary useful for Japanese titles usually transcribed in roman characters. Purist, curious and of course Japanese people will enjoy this.

More to come.
