# GameDataBase

GameDataBase project aims to provide the most detailed information about every videogame (console, computer and arcade) for sorting purposes. Goal is to unify in one place all available useful information for emulation projects like MiSTer, to make possible more efficient and specific searchs. GameDataBase will be published in different files (by platform).

These are basically seven-column files made of metadata fields separated by commas (CSV) as following:

1. Game full title
2. Show title in original character set, if applicable. This is particulary useful for Japanese titles usually transcribed in roman characters. Purist, curious and of course Japanese people will enjoy this.
3. ID (to identify multiple versions of the same game)
4. Date in format YYYY adding MM and DD if known (YYYY-MM-DD)
5. Developer
6. Tags
7. File

Tags:

(#) = Tags with additional information about the game:
  - #1P, #2P... = Number of maximum players available
  - #4W, #8W... = Joystick ways / #0W means there's no stick
  - #1B, #2B... = Number of buttons
  - #spinner, #lightgun... = Non common control system
  - #tate, #triple... = Non common screen
  - #cps, #system16... = arcade board
  - #coop, #vs... = Two or more players mode (cooperative, versus)
  - #mameparent = Parent arcade game in MAME por specific ID

More to come.
